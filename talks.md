## Talks

A list of some of the talks I did in the past on various conferences & events:

### 2013

- __[Making music with JavaScript and Gamepads](http://janmonschke.com/Music-with-JS-and-Gamepads)__ - A talk that explains the basic concepts of both the Web Audio API and the Gamepad API and shows how they can be combined in order to create music. I held this talk at [RejectJS 2013](http://rejectjs.org/) and at the [Google DevFest 2013](http://devfest-berlin.de/#/2013/about). Check out a recording of the talk on YouTube:

### 2012

- __[Genetic Algorithms in JavaScript](http://janmonschke.com/Genetic-Algorithms/presentation)__ - I talked about my experiences with Genetic Algorithms and CoffeeScript / JavaScript at [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org). It also has a [demo](http://janmonschke.com/Genetic-Algorithms/) and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/janmonschke/Genetic-Algorithms).

- Together with [@agento](https://twitter.com/agento) I talked about CoffeeScript at Barcamp Ruhr 5. Unfortunately no slides for this one since it was a freestyle presentation. We mainly showed and explained the examples shown on the [CoffeeScript website](http://coffeescript.org).

- __[Client-Side Development with Brunch](https://speakerdeck.com/janmonschke/client-side-development-with-brunch)__ - I talked about [brunch](http://brunch.io), a tool that helps assembling client-side web apps, at [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org).

### 2011

- __[Single Page Apps](https://speakerdeck.com/janmonschke/single-page-web-apps)__ - Together with [@toshiyori](https://twitter.com/toshiyori) I gave an introduction to Single Page Apps at Barcamp Ruhr 4. It was a pretty hot topic at that time but the slides may be outdated now ;)

### 2010

- __[Barcamps](http://www.slideshare.net/janmonschke/presentation-5747040)__ - At a local uni meetup in DÃ¼sseldorf I talked about Barcamps and especially why students should attend them :)
