## Talks

A list of some of the talks I did in the past on various conferences & events:

### 2014

- __[Using the web for music production and live performances](http://janmonschke.com/JSConf2014)__ - In this talk from JSConf 2014 I present the real-time web audio editor which I worked on in my [Master's Thesis](http://cl.ly/1H111o1w1Z0T) together with my flatmate and my brother which are connected via WebRTC (skip to 6:40 to see this demo). In addition to that demo I also show how the Web Audio API can be used for live music performances at 19:15.

It was held at ScotlandJS in Edinburgh on 9th of May 2014. The topic is described in more detail in my Master's Thesis which can be read found under: <http://cl.ly/1H111o1w1Z0T>.

- __[Making music with JavaScript and Gamepads](http://janmonschke.com/Music-with-JS-and-Gamepads)__ - A talk that explains the basic concepts of both the Web Audio API and the Gamepad API and shows how they can be combined in order to create music. I held this talk at [RejectJS 2013](http://rejectjs.org/) and at the [Google DevFest 2013](http://devfest-berlin.de/#/2013/about). Check out a recording of the talk on YouTube:

### 2012

- __[Genetic Algorithms in JavaScript](http://janmonschke.com/Genetic-Algorithms/presentation)__ - I talked about my experiences with Genetic Algorithms and CoffeeScript / JavaScript at [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org). It also has a [demo](http://janmonschke.com/Genetic-Algorithms/) and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/janmonschke/Genetic-Algorithms).

- Together with [@agento](https://twitter.com/agento) I talked about CoffeeScript at Barcamp Ruhr 5. Unfortunately no slides for this one since it was a freestyle presentation. We mainly showed and explained the examples shown on the [CoffeeScript website](http://coffeescript.org).

- __[Client-Side Development with Brunch](https://speakerdeck.com/janmonschke/client-side-development-with-brunch)__ - I talked about [brunch](http://brunch.io), a tool that helps assembling client-side web apps, at [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org).

### 2011

- __[Single Page Apps](https://speakerdeck.com/janmonschke/single-page-web-apps)__ - Together with [@toshiyori](https://twitter.com/toshiyori) I gave an introduction to Single Page Apps at Barcamp Ruhr 4. It was a pretty hot topic at that time but the slides may be outdated now ;)

### 2010

- __[Barcamps](http://www.slideshare.net/janmonschke/presentation-5747040)__ - At a local uni meetup in DÃ¼sseldorf I talked about Barcamps and especially why students should attend them :)
