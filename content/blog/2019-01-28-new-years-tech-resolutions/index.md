In this post I want to explain a couple of things that I changed since the beginning of this year. They all have to do with the way I use technology but they also have an impact on my social live. Some were a long time coming, some triggered by specific events but I'm mentioning them all in a single post because I changed all three of them within a couple of days in January. So here we go.

## I have deleted my Facebook account

d

- it's been a
- privacy scandals
- actually not using any of its features apart from events and birthday reminders
  -> birthdays in calendar
  -> people still invite me to events through other channels
  -> public events are on other websites as well
- started with a extension that removed the news feed, used it for 6 months
- never installed messenger, so it's easy to live without

## I'm moving away from Gmail

- blah privacy
  - gmail scans for purchases + auto responses -> turning point, always knew they were analyzing a lot but it goes too far
- Switching to fastmail
  - How do I switch?
    - I used that email account for
    - gradual approach
    - when I get an email on the gmail account, I switch the email for that service to the new one
    - when I sign in to a service and I still use gmail, I switch
    - I tell friends to use fastmail from now on
- still have to keep the account
  - android user
  - youtube account

## Using Firefox as my primary browser

- Edge moving to Blink
- Diversity
- Maybe it has to do with privacy concerns
- video playback issue -> use Safari
