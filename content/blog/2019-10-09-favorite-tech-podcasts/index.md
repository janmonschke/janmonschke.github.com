## Tech podcasts

- **[The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)** was probably the first podcast that I listened to back from when I was still studying in 2010 and I still listen to it to this day. Adam and Jared produce a high quality podcast with a wide variety of topics in their episodes. They invite guests of a popular open source project and they interview them about the background of the project and how it can be useful for listeners. They also create episodes on important current topics in the tech world like [Kim Crayton](https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1)'s [#causeascene](https://hashtagcauseascene.com/) movement ([ep. #334](https://changelog.com/podcast/334)) or they talked to [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr) about the `event-stream` compromise ([ep. #326](https://changelog.com/podcast/326)). Episodes are usual 1h to 1.5h long.

- **[JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)** is a spin-off of The Changelog that focuses on JavaScript- and Frontend-related topics. It's also super well produced and you can feel the hosts are well-prepared for their interview partners. The show features a lot of recurring hosts which is refreshing to hear since podcasts are usually hosted by the same people. Episodes range from 1h to 1.5h, just like The Changelog. Full disclosure: I was a guest on one of their episodes where I talked about the Nested Loops project ðŸ˜Š ([ep. 52](https://changelog.com/jsparty/52)).

- **[React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com/)** is a podcast that, you might have guessed it from the name already, specializes on React and its ecosystem. The hosts invite authors of popular libraries, they discuss new trends from the React world and they talk about experiences of working in tech. I can especially recommend the episodes about Gatsby ([ep. 28](https://reactpodcast.com/28)) and The Future of Work ([ep. 65](https://reactpodcast.com/65)).

- **[Cyber by Motherboard](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cyber/id1441708044)** is a podcast about hacks, breaches, security-vulnerabilities and their impact on modern society. The hosts provide great background reporting on hacks that you might have heard about and the ones you have not heard about. My favorite episodes are the ones about a [spyware sting operation](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-spyware-sting-operation/id1441708044?i=1000429241547) and where they report about [how hackers break into iCloud-locked iPhones](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-hackers-break-into-icloud-locked-iphones/id1441708044?i=1000430212873). Their episodes are usually around half an hour long.

  - Bonus podcast about cyber security topics: [Breach](https://www.carbonite.com/podcasts/breach/). A more narrative podcast that has currently two seasons, one in which they talk about the Yahoo hacks and one where they go into detail on the Equifax breach. The reporting in the 2nd season was so good, it actually shook me a lot.
