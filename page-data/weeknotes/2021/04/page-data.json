You can check them out in the video below. It‚Äôs always great to see how powerful a couple of simple CSS animations and transitions can be. I‚Äôm very pleased with the result. ü§©</p>\n<video controls loop alt=\"Somewhere loading animation\">\n  <source src=\"/718557dfb965f62b98aaa9a472f5744b/04-somewhere-animation.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n<h3>Ping</h3>\n<p>I spent only an hour or two on ping this week. I made the sign up screen component more generic to also support sign in. Next step in the proof of concept is to build a basic version of the screen that will let users collaborate.</p>\n<p>Oh and I looked into <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable\">callable functions on Firebase</a>. I‚Äôm currently using Vercel‚Äôs serverless functions but I‚Äôm pretty sure that after the proof of concept I will port those to callable functions. They are just a tad more convenient to work with when you are already using other Firebase products. üî•</p>\n<h2>Life</h2>\n<p>We are moving to a new apartment at the end of March and it‚Äôs really hard to plan a kitchen when all kitchen studios are closed. Pretty much our only option is the IKEA kitchen planner website.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a pretty powerful tool and it must be one hell of a big engineering project. You can build your entire kitchen, it renders an interactive 3D model, checks for potential issues, tells you the price, has a huge catalogue of items etc.</p>\n<p>I looked under the hood a bit and it seems to be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly\">WebAssembly</a> project which made me even more curious ü§Ø.</p>\n<p>Also: IKEA and Web<strong>Assembly</strong>‚Ä¶get it? üòÇ</p>\n<p>Right, I will see myself out üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\n<p>I watched a lot of The Expanse over the weekend and am almost at the end of the current season. To slow me down a bit, I started to read <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168809-the-end-of-all-things\">The end of all things</a> by John Scalzi. Which also is the the final novel in its own series (the Old Man‚Äôs war). It‚Äôs always so annoying to finish a series üòÖ I really need to find new a sci-fi book and/or TV show. Maybe there is something similar to The Expanse?</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/16038/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/507e6/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.webp 200w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/28a80/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.webp 400w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/8d2ea/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.webp 800w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/e00f7/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/37402/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg 200w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/4cda9/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg 400w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/c60e9/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg 800w,\n/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/16038/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/013d0956e5e90923e9fd7fad7b8eb7ea/c60e9/04-ultratinyepicgalaxies.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Ultra tiny epic galaxies\"\n            title=\"Ultra tiny epic galaxies\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Staying true to this week‚Äôs subliminal sci-fi topic, we played <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/285826/ultra-tiny-epic-galaxies\">(Ultra) Tiny Epic Galaxies</a>. I love this game for so many reasons. It‚Äôs both single- and multiplayer, you can adjust the difficulty level and there are so many different planets and abilities to discover. It makes every round unique. Also, the <em>ultra</em> tiny version of this game fits into my pocket üòÑ</p>\n<h2>Song of the week</h2>\n<p>This week I have a Steve Reich remix for you. My favorite remix of ‚Äù<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/steve-reich-official/music-for-18-musicians\">Music For 18 Musicians (Section VI)</a>‚Äù. This one is created by Joe Acheson, the creative mastermind behind <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hiddenorchestra\">Hidden Orchestra</a>. I could not find the track on its own though, only embedded in other mixtapes.
