In the begining of last year, I decided to change the way I consume and navigate content on the internet. All changes also have an impact on my social live. Some were a long time coming and some were triggered by specific events. I want to explain why I took those changes and how they have impacted my life in the last six months.

## Deleting my Facebook account

d

- it's been a
- privacy scandals
- actually not using any of its features apart from events and birthday reminders
  -> birthdays in calendar
  -> people still invite me to events through other channels
  -> public events are on other websites as well
- started with a extension that removed the news feed, used it for 6 months
- never installed messenger, so it's easy to live without

## Moving away from Gmail as my primary e-mail

- blah privacy
  - gmail scans for purchases + auto responses -> turning point, always knew they were analyzing a lot but it goes too far
- Switching to fastmail
  - How do I switch?
    - I used that email account for
    - gradual approach
    - when I get an email on the gmail account, I switch the email for that service to the new one
    - when I sign in to a service and I still use gmail, I switch
    - I tell friends to use fastmail from now on
- still have to keep the account
  - android user
  - youtube account

## Using Firefox as my primary browser

I still remember the day when Firefox was first released. I immediately installed it and was so happy that I did not have to use IE anymore. The browser felt so fresh with its shiny UI and oh did it have some sweet features. It was the first major browser that supported tabbed browsing out of the box. Imagine not having tabs nowadays! It was also able to block pop-ups automatically, which were a plague back then. And it was a lot more secure than IE.

All those features sold me instantly and Firefox was my primary browser for the next 5 years until Chrome got released. When Chrome was released, Firefox was critizised for using a lot of memory and being very slow and Chrome promised to be a very lean and fast alternative. And it did fulfill all tese promises. In addition, it had this amazing set of dev tools that came natively with the browser. It was an easy decision to switch to Chrome because Firefox did indeed feel slow on my old computer and I did not have the money to buy a new one since I just started to study.

Fast forward to now, 10 years later, and I have switched back to Firefox again. The reason for this switch are more political then technical reasons. It's not that Chrome has suddenly become slow and unusable for me. I think Chrome and Firefox are pretty much on par when it comes to speed and dev tools so there is no reason for me to prefer Chrome anymore.

In addition to that I am quite a bit concerned

- Edge moving to Blink
- Chrome policy to prevent adblockers
- Diversity
- Maybe it has to do with privacy concerns
- video playback issue -> use Safari
