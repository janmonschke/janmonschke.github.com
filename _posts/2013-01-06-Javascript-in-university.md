When I started my Master's studies at HTW Berlin in 2011 I was already fully web-focused. All my side-projects and freelance jobs where web-related. Even my Bachelor Thesis was 100% web.
I came to HTW Berlin in order to focus even more on web technology since they're offering a specilization in web in their [Master's programme](http://htw-berlin.de).

Unluckily, the professor who was doing all the web courses before I came to Berlin got an offer from another university and went away so that I ended up having substitutional profs in almost all web courses.
