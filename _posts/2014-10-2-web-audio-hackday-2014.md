Earlier this year [Jan Lehnardt](https://twitter.com/janl){:target="_blank"}, [Rin](https://twitter.com/rinpaku){:target="_blank"}, [Robin](https://twitter.com/rmehner){:target="_blank"}, [Tiffany](https://twitter.com/theophani){:target="_blank"} and me started to talk about making something special for the upcoming JSConf.eu (2014). Our idea was to organize a JSFest in Berlin around the three big conferences in September (Reject.JS, CSSConf.eu and JSConf.eu) which would host a range of web-related Meetups and Events. [Explain that we didnt want to have a big team but rather smaller independent groups that organize events]

For more than two years I am now obsessed with writing things with the Web Audio API which is becoming more and more stable and is supported by more and more browsers. I wanted to share my enthusiasm for this API by creating a Web Audio Hackathon during JSFest. Since I never organised an event before, Tiffany, who is familiar with all the prcoesses that are needed to create big events like JSConf.eu, joined the organiser team and we started planning very soon.

The event took place at the SoundCloud HQ in Berlin in the wonderful classroom :)

We were able to have three amazing speakers from Mozilla and Google which introduced attendees to the Web Audio API and the Web Midi API. To be honest, I was [pretty](https://twitter.com/thedeftone/status/498877909525090304) [stoked](https://twitter.com/thedeftone/status/497779074585329664) to have the three of them talking at the event because they have always been my Web Audio Heroes <3

[Soledad PenadÃ©s](https://twitter.com/supersole){:target="_blank"} gave a very insightful introduction to the Web Audio API that was suited for both beginners and more advanced users. Since most of the 30 attendees were novice users this was perfect. I especially liked her very creative way of explaining the core features of the Web Audio API as [Super Powers](http://soledadpenades.com/files/t/berlin-webaudio-hackday-2014/#38){:target="_blank"} and her description and demonstration of LFOs as [spooky sounds](http://soledadpenades.com/files/t/berlin-webaudio-hackday-2014/#54) :) The slides can be found [here](http://soledadpenades.com/files/t/berlin-webaudio-hackday-2014/){:target="_blank"} and a recording of her talk from a Mozilla event can be found [here](https://air.mozilla.org/introduction-to-web-audio/){:target="_blank"}.
